			<h1>The Early Years</h1>
			<p>In 1974, Alexander Schure recruited computer scientists to create the Computer Graphics Lab, with the goal of creating the first ever computer animated feature film. Realising they needed to work in a film studio in order to reach their goal, these employees decided to move over to Lucasfilm, joining The Graphics Group.</p>

			<p>It was here that the researchers pioneered many of the CG foundation techniques — in particular the inventions of the alpha channel; REYES (for "renders everything you ever saw”), which was the precursor to RenderMan; "particle effects”; and various other animation tools.</p>

			<p>During this time, the group at the Computer Graphics Lab produced a few frames of an experimental film called “The Works”. Although unreleased, the project resulted in other groundbreaking computer animations such as 3DV, Sunstone, Inside a Quark and some segments of the short film The Magic Egg, from 1984.</p>

			<h2>Toy Story and The Braintrust</h2>
			<p>Pixar, headed by Edwin Catmull and Alvy Ray Smith, became an independent company in 1986. During this period, Pixar began its successful relationship with Walt Disney Animation Studios, with the two companies signing a historic $26 million deal to produce three computer-animated feature films, the first of which was Toy Story. As a result of the success of Toy Story, which went on to gross more than $373 million worldwide, Pixar built their studio at the Emeryville campus.</p>

			<p>During the 1990s and 2000s, Pixar gradually developed the "Pixar Braintrust," the studio's primary creative development process, in which all directors, writers, and lead storyboard artists at the studio look at each other's projects on a regular basis and give each other very candid notes. The Braintrust ensures Pixar operates under a philosophy of a "filmmaker-driven studio”, as opposed to the traditional Hollywood approach of an "executive-driven studio" .
			</p>

			<h2>Disney</h2>
			<p>The agreement with Disney wasn’t always smooth sailing. Following the release of Toy Story 2, although profitable for both, Pixar complained that the arrangement was not equitable. Amongst other issues, perhaps the most onerous aspect to Pixar was that Disney exclusively owned all story, character and sequel rights. This set the stage for a contentious relationship.</p>

			<p>In 2006, when Disney ultimately agreed to buy Pixar, Disney Animation adopted the basic principles of the Pixar Braintrust (although meetings of the Disney Story Trust are reportedly "more polite" than those of the Pixar Braintrust). Despite this, it was decided that in order to maintain the studios' separate identities and cultures, a hard line was to be drawn that ensured that each studio was solely responsible for its own projects and would not be allowed to borrow personnel from or lend tasks out to the other. For example, when Pixar had issues with Ratatouille and Disney Animation had issues with Bolt, nobody bailed them out and each studio was required to solve the problem on its own, even when they knew there were personnel at the other studio who theoretically could have helped.
